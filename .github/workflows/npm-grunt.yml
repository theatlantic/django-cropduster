with your return, allow 11 weeks. To check
the status of your refund, do one of the
following.
• Go to www.irs.gov/Refunds.
• Call 1-800-829-4477 for automated refund
information and follow the recorded
instructions.
• Call 1-800-829-1954.
Important Notes for EROs
• Don’t send Form 8879 to the IRS unless
requested to do so. Retain the completed
Form 8879 for 3 years from the return due
date or IRS received date, whichever is later.
Form 8879 may be retained electronically in
accordance with the recordkeeping guidelines
in Rev. Proc. 97-22, which is on page 9 of
Internal Revenue Bulletin 1997-13 at
www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb97-13.pdf.
• Confirm the identity of the taxpayer(s).
• Complete Part III only if you are filing the
return using the Practitioner PIN method. You
aren’t required to enter the taxpayer’s date of
birth, prior year adjusted gross income, or PIN
in the Authentication Record of the
electronically filed return.
• If you aren’t using the Practitioner PIN
method, enter the taxpayer(s) date of birth
and either the adjusted gross income or the
PIN, or both, from the taxpayer’s prior year
originally filed return in the Authentication
Record of the taxpayer’s electronically filed
return. Don’t use an amount from an
amended return or a math error correction
made by the IRS.
• Enter the taxpayer’s PIN(s) on the input
screen only if the taxpayer has authorized you
to do so. If married filing jointly, it is
acceptable for one spouse to authorize you to
enter his or her PIN, and for the other spouse
to enter his or her own PIN. It isn’t acceptable
for a taxpayer to select or enter the PIN of an
absent spouse.
• Taxpayers must use a PIN to sign their
e-filed individual income tax return
transmitted by an ERO.
• Provide the taxpayer with a copy of the
signed Form 8879 for his or her records upon
request.
• Provide the taxpayer with a corrected copy
of Form 8879 if changes are made to the
return (for example, based on taxpayer
review).
• EROs can sign the form using a rubber
stamp, mechanical device (such as a
signature pen), or computer software
program. See Notice 2007-79, 2007-42 I.R.B.

Form 941 (Rev. 6-2022)
Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice.
We ask for the information on Form 941 to carry out the
Internal Revenue laws of the United States. We need it to
figure and collect the right amount of tax. Subtitle C,
Employment Taxes, of the Internal Revenue Code
imposes employment taxes on wages and provides for
income tax withholding. Form 941 is used to determine
the amount of taxes that you owe. Section 6011 requires
you to provide the requested information if the tax is
applicable to you. Section 6109 requires you to provide
your identification number. If you fail to provide this
information in a timely manner, or provide false or
fraudulent information, you may be subject to penalties.
You’re not required to provide the information
requested on a form that is subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act unless the form displays a valid OMB
control number. Books and records relating to a form or
its instructions must be retained as long as their contents
may become material in the administration of any Internal
Revenue law.
Generally, tax returns and return information are
confidential, as required by section 6103. However,
section 6103 allows or requires the IRS to disclose or
give the information shown on your tax return to others
as described in the Code. For example, we may
disclose your tax information to the Department of
Justice for civil and criminal litigation, and to cities,
states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. commonwealths
and possessions for use in administering their tax laws.
We may also disclose this information to other countries
under a tax treaty, to federal and state agencies to
enforce federal nontax criminal laws, or to federal law
enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat
terrorism.
The time needed to complete and file Form 941 will
vary depending on individual circumstances. The

Learning about the law or the form . . . . 53 min.
Preparing, copying, assembling, and

If you have comments concerning the accuracy of
these time estimates or suggestions for making Form 941
simpler, we would be happy to hear from you. You can
